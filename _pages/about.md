Hi! I'm a Research Associate at the University of Bristol, working on the [TORUS project](https://torus.ac.uk). I completed my PhD in Computer Vision under the supervision of [Professor Majid Mirmehdi](https://majidmirmehdi.github.io) and [Dr. Alan Whone](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/alan-l-whone), focusing on learning strategies for Parkinson's disease assessment. My research interests include **Parameter-Efficient Learning**, **Domain Adaptation**, **Self-Supervised Learning**, and **Edge AI Deployment**. I'm particularly passionate about developing methods that work effectively with unlabelled/limited labeled data and can be efficiently deployed on resource-constrained hardware.
